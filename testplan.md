## 1 Continuous stationary low power jamming with commercially available jammers

### Rationale for test


The main objective is to observe how the J/S signal affect the availability of PNT, and/or how it produces inaccurate PNT data, when the jamming signal (J) is generated by low-power jammers commercially available online. It will also allow participants to create a reference against other, more sophisticated transmission test cases. Additionally, as these types of jammers are the ones one is most likely to meet in the real world, capturing and storing the signals from these jammers for later use in labs could be useful. The use of continuous low power jamming will block out only a certain area. The attendees may therefore test the range of such a low-power jammer. Technical information on jammers can be found as appendix. The jammers used are acquirable from the internet, and each will either be representable for a specific jammer category, or be of special interest for the rest of the test week.
### Test setup


All tests will be performed as follows: The jammer will be activated while placed outside, on top of a stationary vehicle. The jammer will be kept turned on for two (2) minutes, and a two-minute break will be held between each test case. This scenario can be performed and/or repeated at multiple test areas. When activated, all jammers will have all possible GNSS jamming bands activate. If all 28 low effect jammers are tested in sequence, the test will take approximately 2 hours and 2 minutes, which include a 10-minute extra break at the end of the last jammer.
